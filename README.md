Project Status: Preliminary Design Stage

# csgeom: Computational Geometry in C#
![csgeom](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bennywwg/csgeom/master/csgeom/csgeom/logo.png)

Warning! This project is very incomplete and buggy. Additionally, since the project is incomplete, there is an additional visual studio project "csgeom_test" included in this repo, which has a GUI that I use to test the actual library. This project will not be included in the final version of csgeom, and is also pretty buggy right now.

This is a computational geometry library written in C#, csgeom! This library will be able to perform nontrivial geometry operations on polygons and polyhedrons.

* Reduce polygons to sets of convex polygons
* Triangulate polygons
* Find area of polygons
* Find center of area of polygons
* Boolan operations on polygons, ie constructive solid geometry


* Reduce polyhedrons to sets of convex polyhedrons
* Reduce polyhedrons to tetrahedrons
* Volume of polyhedrons
* Center of volume of polyhedrons
* Boolean operations on polyhedrons

Coming soon: sample code in this README!
